1.Var
      it is a function-scoped that  has  early days in JavaScript.

• the  var variables are inside in a function and fixed outside of the 

function f() {

    // can be accessible any
    // within this function
    var a = 30;
    console.log(a)
}
f();

// cannot be accessible
// outside of function
console.log(a);


•The code below are re-declare  variable that some of name are same scope using the var keyword, which can provide no error in the case of var keyword

var a = 30

// User can re-declare
// variable using var
var a = 10

// User can update var variable
a = 9
console.log(a);

• The code below  explains the concept of hosting  with  var keyword variables

console.log(a);
var a = 30;

2. Let
     Let is a variable within the specific block of code.That can allow to assign value to variable that changed within the scope.

• The below code declares the variable using the let keyword.

let a = 30;
function f() {
    let b = 29
    console.log(b);
    console.log(a);
}
f();


• The code below are  explains the block scope of the variables declared using the let keyword.

let a = 31;
function f() {
    if (true) {
        let b = 30

        // prints 30
        console.log(b);
    }

    // gives error 
    // defined in if block
    console.log(b);
}
f()

// prints 31
console.log(a)

• The code below explains the behaviour of let variables when they are re-declared in the same scope

let a = 30

// not allowed
let a = 30

// allowed
a = 30

• The code below  explains the behaviour of let variables when they are re-declared in the different scopes

let a = 30
if (true) {
    let a = 29
    console.log(a) // prints 29
}
console.log(a) // prints 30

•This code explains the use of the const keyword to declare the JavaScript objects

3. Const
     Const is also a specific block of code that  declare constants and cannot be reassigned after initialization.

const a = {
    prop1: 30,
    prop2: 29
}

// allowed
a.prop1 = 3

// not allowed
a = {
    b: 30,
    prop2: 29
}

• This code  change the value of the const variable.

const a = 30;
function f() {
    a = 29
    console.log(a)
}
f();
